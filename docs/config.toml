# Configuration for Tobira.
#
# All relative paths are relative to the location of this configuration file.
# Duration values are specified as string with a unit, e.g. "27s". Valid
# units: 'ms', 's', 'min', 'h' and 'd'.
#
# All user-facing texts you can configure here have to be specified per
# language, with two letter language key. Only English ('en') is required.
# Take `general.site_title` for example:
#
#     [general]
#     site_title.en = "My university"
#     site_title.de = "Meine Universit√§t"
#

[general]
# The main title of the video portal. Used in the HTML `<title>`, as main
# heading on the home page, and potentially more.
#
# Required! This value must be specified.

# Links that are shown in the footer. By default, two links are shown:
#
# ```
# footer_links = ["about", "graphiql"]
# ```
#
# By overwriting this value, you can remove the default links and add
# custom ones. Note that these two default links are special and can be
# specified with only the shown string. To add custom ones, you need to
# define a label and a link. Example:
#
# ```
# footer_links = [
#     { label = { en = "Example" }, link = "https://example.com" },
#     "about",

[auth]
# The mode of authentication. Compare the authentication docs! Possible values:
#
# - "none": Tobira never reads auth headers and thus, users cannot login
#    at all. Only useful for development and as safe default.
# - "full-auth-proxy": Tobira does no session handling and expects an auth
#   proxy in front of every route, passing user info via auth headers.
# - "login-proxy": Tobira does its own session handling and expects the auth
#    system to send `POST /~session` with auth headers to create a session.
#
# **Important**: in either case, you HAVE to make sure to remove all auth
# headers from incoming user requests before passing them on to Tobira!
#
# Default value: "none"

# (not via `<a>`, but through JavaScript) links to Tobira's own login page.

#
#     openssl ecparam -name secp256r1 -genkey -noout -out sec1.pem
#     openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in sec1.pem -out private-key.pem

#
# Required! This value must be specified.

[sync]
# Host of the connected Opencast instance. This host has to be reachable
# via HTTPS (or HTTP, see `use_insecure_connection`). If no port is
# specified here, the default HTTPS port 443 (or HTTP port 80) is used.
# Example: "localhost:8080".
#
# Required! This value must be specified.
#host =

# If set to `true`, Tobira will communicate with Opencast via HTTP instead of
# HTTPS. This is strongly recommended against! The HTTP requests contain the
# unencrypted `sync_password`! Setting this to `true` is only allowed if

#password =

# A rough estimate of how many items (events & series) are transferred in
# each HTTP request while harvesting (syncing) with the Opencast
# instance.
#
# A very large number might cause problems due to the Opencast or Tobira
# node having to hold that many items in memory, or due to network
# request size restrictions. Too small of a number not means that the
# overhead of each request will become more significant, slowing down
# harvesting. But more importantly: if your Opencast instance has more
# items with exactly the same `updated` timestamp than the configured
# `preferred_harvest_size`, Tobira is unable to harvest. The `updated`
# timestamp is has millisecond precision, so this situation is highly
# unlikely to occur naturally. However, this can easily occur with
# artificial timestamps, like when you migrate old Opencast data
# (without an `updated` timestamp). Be aware of that.

# Default value: 500
#preferred_harvest_size = 500
