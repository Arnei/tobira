# Introduction

Tobira is a video portal for [Opencast](https://opencast.org), i.e. it aims to be a pleasant interface through which users interact with your Opencast content.
Videos and series can be presented in a customizable, hierarchical page structure, but users can also easily search through all media.
Additionally, Tobira offers tools to upload and manage videos.
It's possible to connect Tobira to virtually any authentication system and integrate it into your university's/organization's infrastructure.

What you see here is Tobira's documentation.
This should teach you everything you need to know about this software.
If the documentation lacks a topic you would find helpful, or if you find a mistake, please open an issue or pull request [in our GitHub repository](https://github.com/elan-ev/tobira) to let us know. Thanks! ðŸ™‚
