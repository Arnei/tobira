# Supported Browsers

Tobira officially supports:
- The latest two versions of Firefox, Chrome, and Edge
- Safari ≥ 15

For Firefox, Chrome and Edge, it is very likely that versions a lot older than the latest two also work with Tobira flawlessly.
We just don't officially promise it.

We try to support all viewports (i.e. screen sizes) with a width ≥ 320px.
At default zoom level, that covers basically all smartphones released in the past 5+ years.
Even with a strong zoom level (e.g. for accesibility reasons), most modern smart phones have a viewport width of ≥ 320px.
If you find a page that is unusable or looks bad on a small screen, please open an issue.
