 * This looks a bit funny, but is essentially an encoding of existential types.
 * So what we need is an array of routes. But `Route` has a type parameter. We
 * could of course set the type to `Route<any>[]` and it would work, but with
 * two disadvantages: (a) in our code, we would have to deal with `any`s and
 * would lose type checking ability, and (b) user code could also lose type
 * checking ability. So the type we "need" is: `(âˆƒ T: Route<T>)[]`.
 *
 * However, TS does not have existential types built-in. Luckily, there are
 * workarounds. We use "continuations" here. It's just two indirections through
 * callables. It makes our code below slightly less readable, but it's still
 * fine and at least we get proper type checking! For more information, see:
