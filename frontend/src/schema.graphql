    is just the concatenation of all the path segments between the root realm
    and the realm in question, delimited by `"/"`. The root realm is assumed
    to have a path segment of `""`, and with the above rule so is its full
    path. The path of every other realm will start with `"/"` delimiting the
    root realm path segement from the second segment in the path.
